# hello-scalatra-slick #

The purpose of this project is to learn the ropes about [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), [Scalatra](http://www.scalatra.org) & [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com).  Slick is a really incredible orm like library for scala, but sort of hard to learn because it is just created to replace the library ScalaQuery, and it took me a little while to find all the resources to help me learn it.

I had based this project on the info found on these various websites

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd hello-scalatra
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

## Quick Run
If you just want to look at the results quickly, use sandbox.sc worksheet to quickly see how slick works in scala.
